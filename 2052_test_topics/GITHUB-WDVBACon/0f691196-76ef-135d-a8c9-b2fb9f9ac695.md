# KeyBinding Object (Word)

Represents a custom key assignment in the current context. The  **KeyBinding** object is a member of the **KeyBindings** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **KeyBindings** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **KeyBinding** object. The following example displays the command associated with the first **KeyBinding** object in the **[KeyBindings](d2e38b04-b7e1-b35c-e511-5988d132b074.md)** collection.


```
MsgBox KeyBindings(1).Command
```

You can also use the  **FindKey** property and the **Key** method to return a **KeyBinding** object.


 **注释**  Custom key assignments are made in the  **Customize Keyboard** dialog box.
