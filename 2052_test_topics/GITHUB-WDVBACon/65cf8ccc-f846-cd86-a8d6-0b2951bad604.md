# Application.UserControl Property (Word)

 **True** if the document or application was created or opened by the user. Read-only **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **UserControl**

 _表达式_ A variable that represents an **[Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **UserControl** property returns **False** if the application was created or opened programmatically from another Microsoft Office application with the **Open** method or the **CreateObject** or **GetObject** method.


 **注释**  If Word is visible to the user, or if you call the  **UserControl** property of an **Application** object from within a code module, this property will always return **True**.


## Example

This example displays the status of the  **UserControl** property for the active document. This example will only work correctly when run from another Office application with the Word object library loaded.


```
Set wd = New Word.Application 
Set wdDoc = _ 
 wd.Documents.Open("C:\My Documents\doc1.doc") 
If wdDoc.UserControl = True Then 
 MsgBox "This document was created or opened by the user." 
Else 
 MsgBox "This document was created programmatically." 
End If
```
