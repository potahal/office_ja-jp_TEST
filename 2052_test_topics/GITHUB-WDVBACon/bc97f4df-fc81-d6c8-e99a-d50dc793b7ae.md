# Font Object (Word)

Contains font attributes (such as font name, font size and color) for an object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Font** property to return the **Font** object. The following instruction applies bold formatting to the selection.


```
Selection.Font.Bold = True
```

The following example formats the first paragraph in the active document as 24point Arial and italic.




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range
With myRange.Font
    .Bold = True
    .Name = "Arial"
    .Size = 24
End With
```

The following example changes the formatting of the Heading 2 style in the active document to Arial and bold.




```
With ActiveDocument.Styles(wdStyleHeading2).Font
    .Name = "Arial"
    .Italic = True
End With
```

You can use the  **New** keyword to create a new, stand-alone **Font** object. The following example creates a **Font** object, sets some formatting properties, and then applies the **Font** object to the first paragraph in the active document.




```
Set myFont = New Font
myFont.Bold = True
myFont.Name = "Arial"
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Font = myFont
```

You can also duplicate a  **Font** object by using the **Duplicate**property. The following example creates a new character style with the character formatting from the selection and italic formatting. The formatting of the selection is not changed.




```
Set aFont = Selection.Font.Duplicate
aFont.Italic = True
ActiveDocument.Styles.Add(Name:="Italics", _
    Type:=wdStyleTypeCharacter).Font = aFont
```
