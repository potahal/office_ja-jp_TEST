# Document.Close Event (Word)

Occurs when a document is closed.


## Syntax

Private Sub  _表达式_ _ **Close**()

 _表达式_ A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

If the event procedure is stored in a template, the procedure will run when a new document based on that template is closed and when the template itself is closed (after being opened as a document).



For information about using events with a  **Document** object, see[Using Events with the Document Object](2b043342-436a-5421-e8af-3c2c49684960.md).




## Example

This example makes a backup copy of the document on a file server when the document is closed. (The procedure can be stored in the ThisDocument class module of a document or its attached template.)


```
Private Sub Document_Close() 
 ActiveDocument.Save 
 ActiveDocument.SaveAs "\\network\backup\" &amp; ThisDocument.Name 
End Sub
```
