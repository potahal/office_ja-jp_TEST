# Range.MoveEnd Method (Word)

Moves the ending character position of a range. .


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **MoveEnd**( ** _Unit_**, ** _Count_** )

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Unit_|可选|**WdUnits**|The unit by which to move the ending character position.|
| _Count_|可选|**Variant**|The number of units to move. If this number is positive, the ending character position is moved forward in the document. If this number is negative, the end is moved backward. If the ending position overtakes the starting position, the range collapses and both character positions move together. The default value is 1.|

## Remarks

This method returns an integer that indicates the number of units the range actually moved, or it returns 0 (zero) if the move was unsuccessful.


## Example

This example sets  _myRange_ to be equal to the second word in the active document. The **MoveEnd** method is used to move the ending position of _myRange_ (a range object) forward one word. After this macro is run, the second and third words in the document are selected.


```
If ActiveDocument.Words.Count >= 3 Then 
 Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Words(2) 
 With myRange 
 .MoveEnd Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1 
 .Select 
 End With 
End If
```
