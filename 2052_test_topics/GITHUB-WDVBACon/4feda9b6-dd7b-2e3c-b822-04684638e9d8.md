# Document.Reload Method (Word)

Reloads a cached document by resolving the hyperlink to the document and downloading it.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Reload**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

This method reloads the document asynchronously; that is, statements following the  **Reload** method in your procedure may execute before the document is actually reloaded. Because of this, you may get unexpected results from using this method in your macros.


## Example

This example opens and reloads the hyperlink to the address "main" on a local intranet.


```
With ActiveDocument 
 .FollowHyperlink Address:="http://main" 
 .Reload 
End With
```
