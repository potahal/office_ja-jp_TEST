# ShapeRange.HeightRelative Property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the percentage of the target shape to which the range of shapes is sized. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **HeightRelative**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **[ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks

Use this property with the  **[RelativeVerticalSize](d0842799-9597-fae2-dd54-dfc404c14f59.md)** property. When set to **wdShapeSizeRelativeNone** (-999999) (see the **[WdShapeSizeRelative](a341aab8-370c-6d29-d640-f8c029a017f1.md)** enumeration), this property should be ignored because the shape does not use percent sizing. The height is solely determined by the **[Height](a11515c7-19d1-b113-cce9-b8c94c6ccbc7.md)** property.
