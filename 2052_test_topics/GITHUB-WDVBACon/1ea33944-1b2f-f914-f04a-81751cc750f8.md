## Example

The following code example prompts the user for a yes or no response before enabling editing on a document in a protected view window. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized for this code example to work correctly. For more information about how to do this, see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).

The following code example assumes that you have declared an application variable called "App" in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Word Application object.




```
Private Sub App_ProtectedViewWindowBeforeEdit(ByVal PvWindow As ProtectedViewWindow, Cancel As Boolean) 
 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Do you really " _ 
 &amp; "want to edit the document?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub 

```
