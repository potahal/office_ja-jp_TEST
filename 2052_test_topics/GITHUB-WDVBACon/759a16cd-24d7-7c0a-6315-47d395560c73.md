# Selection.RtlRun Method (Word)

Sets the reading order and alignment of the specified run to right-to-left.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **RtlRun**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks

For the specified run, this method sets the reading order to right-to-left. If a paragraph in the run with a left-to-right reading order is also left-aligned, this method reverses its reading order and sets its paragraph alignment to right-aligned.

Use the  **ReadingOrder** property to change the reading order without affecting paragraph alignment.


## Example

This example sets the reading order and alignment of the specified run to right-to-left if the selection isn't styled as "Normal."


```
If Selection.Style <> "Normal" Then _ 
 Selection.RtlRun
```
