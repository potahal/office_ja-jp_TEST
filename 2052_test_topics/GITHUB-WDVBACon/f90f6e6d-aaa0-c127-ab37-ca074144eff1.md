# Dialog Object (Word)

Represents a built-in dialog box. The  **Dialog** object is a member of the **[Dialogs](8dfa5d8a-bb81-1cdd-853b-3acf9db70aa9.md)** collection. The **Dialogs** collection contains all the built-in dialog boxes in Word. You cannot create a new built-in dialog box or add one to the **Dialogs** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **Dialogs** (Index), where Index is a **WdWordDialog** constant that identifies the dialog box, to return a single **Dialog** object. The following example displays and carries out the actions taken in the built-in **Open** dialog box.


```
dlgAnswer = Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show
```

The  **WdWordDialog** constants are formed from the prefix "wdDialog" followed by the name of the menu and the dialog box. For example, the constant for the **Page Setup** dialog box is **wdDialogFilePageSetup**, and the constant for the **New** dialog box is **wdDialogFileNew**.
