# ShapeRange.Top Property (Word)

Returns or sets the vertical position of the specified shape or shape range in points. Read/write  **Single**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Top**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks

The position of a shape is measured from the upper-left corner of the shape's bounding box to the shape's anchor. The  **RelativeVerticalPosition** property controls whether the shape's anchor is positioned alongside the line, the paragraph, the margin, or the edge of the page.

For a  **ShapeRange** object that contains more than one shape, the **Top** property sets the vertical position of each shape.


## Example

This example sets the vertical position of the first and second shapes in the active document to 1 inch from the top of the page.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes.Range(Array(1, 2)) 
 .RelativeVerticalPosition = wdRelativeVerticalPositionPage 
 .Top = InchesToPoints(1) 
End With
```
