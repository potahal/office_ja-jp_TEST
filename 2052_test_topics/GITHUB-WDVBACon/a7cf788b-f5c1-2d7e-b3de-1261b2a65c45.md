# Options.DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault Property (Word)

Disables all features introduced after a the specified version for all documents. Read/write  **WdDisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents an **[Options](873b7b99-3fe1-fd89-9ece-a9355cb827dc.md)** collection.


## Remarks

The  **DisableFeaturesByDefault** property must be set to **True** prior to setting the **DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterByDefault** property. Otherwise, the setting will not take effect and will remain at its default setting of Word 97 for Windows.

The  **DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterByDefault** property sets a global option for the application and affects all documents. If you want to disable features introduced after a specified version for a document only, use the **DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfter** property.


## Example

This example disables all features introduced after Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0 and 7.0a, for all documents.


```
Sub FeaturesDisableByDefault() 
 With Application.Options 
 
 'Checks whether features are disabled 
 If .DisableFeaturesbyDefault = True Then 
 
 'If they are, disables all features after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault = wd70 
 Else 
 
 'If not, turns on the disable features option and disables 
 'all features introduced after Word for Windows 95 
 .DisableFeaturesbyDefault = True 
 .DisableFeaturesIntroducedAfterbyDefault = wd70 
 End If 
 End With 
End Sub
```
