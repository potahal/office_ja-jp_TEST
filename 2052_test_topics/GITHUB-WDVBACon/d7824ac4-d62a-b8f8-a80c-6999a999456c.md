# Reviewer Object (Word)

Represents a single reviewer of a document in which changes have been tracked. The  **Reviewer** object is a member of the **[Reviewers](ae1bec96-e6dc-39f0-421a-dfeeb95c9049.md)** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **Reviewers** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the name or number of the reviewer, to return a **Reviewer** object. Use the **Visible** property to display or hide individual reviewers in a document. The following code example hides the reviewer named "Jeff Smith" and displays the reviewer named "Judy Lew." This assumes that "Jeff Smith" and "Judy Lew" are members of the **Reviewers** collection. If they are not, you will receive an error.


```
Sub ShowHide() 
 With ActiveWindow.View 
 .Reviewers("Jeff Smith").Visible = False 
 .Reviewers("Judy Lew").Visible = True 
 End With 
End Sub
```
