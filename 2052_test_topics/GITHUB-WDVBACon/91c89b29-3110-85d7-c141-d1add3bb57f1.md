## Example

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before closing any document. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md) for directions on how to accomplish this.
