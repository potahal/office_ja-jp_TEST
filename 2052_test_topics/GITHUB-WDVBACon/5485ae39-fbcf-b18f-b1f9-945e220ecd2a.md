# Category Object (Word)

Represents an individual category of a building block type.


## Remarks

Microsoft Word uses types and categories to organize building blocks. Each building block type is represented by a  **[WdBuildingBlockTypes](be7fcedb-04fd-f27d-8f36-3120ca263f06.md)** constant. Each category is a unique string that a user defines. Word comes with two categories already defined: "General" and "Custom"; you can create additional categories as you need.

Use the  **[Type](6d8cf5a5-0b6f-572b-c3ae-ecf18fe276a9.md)** property to access the building block type associated with a specific category. Use the **[BuildingBlocks](cdb6e59f-e206-cc0f-82bb-44736e9c859f.md)** property to access the collection of building blocks for a category. The following example prints the type and category names of all the building blocks in the first template to the **Immediate Window**. (This example assumes that the **Immediate Window** is visible.)




```
Dim objTemplate As Template 
Dim objBBT As BuildingBlockType 
Dim objCat As Category 
Dim intCount As Integer 
Dim intCountCat As Integer 
 
Set objTemplate = Templates(1) 
 
For intCount = 1 To objTemplate.BuildingBlockTypes.Count 
 Set objBBT = objTemplate.BuildingBlockTypes(intCount) 
 If objBBT.Categories.Count > 0 Then 
 Debug.Print objBBT.Name 
 For intCountCat = 1 To objBBT.Categories.Count 
 Set objCat = objBBT.Categories(intCountCat) 
 Debug.Print vbTab &amp; objCat.Name 
 Next 
 End If 
Next
```

Use the  **Item** method of the **Categories** collection to access an exising category; to create a new category, use the **Add** method of the **BuildingBlockEntries** collection. Set the value of the Category parameter.
