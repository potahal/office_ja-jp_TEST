## Example

The following code example prompts the user for a yes or no response before closing any document. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work. For more information about how to do this, see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).

The following code example assumes that you have declared an application variable called "App" in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Word Application object.




```
Private Sub App_ProtectedViewWindowBeforeClose(ByVal PvWindow As ProtectedViewWindow, ByVal CloseReason As Long, Cancel As Boolean) 
Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
    intResponse = MsgBox("Do you really " _ 
        &amp; "want to close the document?", _ 
        vbYesNo) 
 
    If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
 
End Sub
```
