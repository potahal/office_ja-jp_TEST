# Find Object (Word)

Represents the criteria for a find operation. 


## Remarks

The properties and methods of the  **Find** object correspond to the options in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.

Use the  **Find** property to return a **Find** object. The following example finds and selects the next occurrence of the word "hi."




```
With Selection.Find
    .ClearFormatting
    .Text = "hi"
    .Execute Forward:=True
End With
```

The following example finds all occurrences of the word "hi" in the active document and replaces the word with "hello."




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Content
myRange.Find.Execute FindText:="hi", ReplaceWith:="hello", _
    Replace:=wdReplaceAll
```

Remarks

If you've gotten to the  **Find** object from the **Selection** object, the selection is changed when text matching the find criteria is found. The following example selects the next occurrence of the word "blue."




```
Selection.Find.Execute FindText:="blue", Forward:=True
```

If you've gotten to the  **Find** object from the **Range** object, the selection isn't changed when text matching the find criteria is found, but the **Range** object is redefined. The following example locates the first occurrence of the word "blue" in the active document. If "blue" is found in the document, _myRange_ is redefined and bold formatting is applied to "blue."




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Content
myRange.Find.Execute FindText:="blue", Forward:=True
If myRange.Find.Found = True Then myRange.Bold = True
```
