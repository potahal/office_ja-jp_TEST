# Document.UserControl Property (Word)

 **True** if the document was created or opened by the user. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **UserControl**

 _表达式_ A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property returns  **False** if the document was created or opened programmatically from another Microsoft Office application with the **Open** method or the Visual Basic **CreateObject** or **GetObject** command.


 **注释**  If Word is visible to the user or if you call the  **UserControl** property from within a Word code module, this property will always return **True**.


## Example

This example displays the status of the  **UserControl** property for the active document. This example will only work correctly when run from another Office application with the Word object library loaded.


```
Set wd = New Word.Application 
Set wdDoc = _ 
 wd.Documents.Open("C:\My Documents\doc1.doc") 
If wdDoc.UserControl = True Then 
 MsgBox "This document was created or opened by the user." 
Else 
 MsgBox "This document was created programmatically." 
End If
```
