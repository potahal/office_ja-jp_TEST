# Conflict.Accept Method (Word)

Accepts the user specified conflict change, and removes the conflict.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Accept**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **Conflict** object.

## Remarks

In a conflict, a user can choose either to keep or to reject the changes they have made to the content where the conflict exists. The  **Accept** method keeps the changes that the user has made.


## Example

The following example accepts all of the conflicts in the active document.


```
Dim conf As Conflict 
 
For Each conf In ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Conflicts 
    conf.Accept 
Next conf
```

Alternatively, you can use the [AcceptAll](8ccb2b0c-77ca-ff27-1e8d-5c1d504d8821.md) method of the[Conflicts](476e8f6d-c93e-b372-2fa7-1c9a4a84a182.md) collection object to accept all the conflicts in a document, as shown in the following code example.
