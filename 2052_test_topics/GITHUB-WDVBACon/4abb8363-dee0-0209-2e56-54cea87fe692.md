# Application.FeatureInstall Property (Word)

Returns or sets how Microsoft Word handles calls to methods and properties that require features not yet installed. Read/write  **MsoFeatureInstall**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **FeatureInstall**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents an **[Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


## Remarks

You can use the  **msoFeatureInstallOnDemandWithUI** constant to prevent users from believing that the application isn't responding while a feature is being installed. Use the **msoFeatureInstallNone** constant if you want the developer to be the only one who can install features.

If you have the  **DisplayAlerts** property set to **False**, users will not be prompted to install new features even if the **FeatureInstall** property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**. If the **DisplayAlerts** property is set to **True**, an installation progress meter will appear if the **FeatureInstall** property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**.


## Example

This example activates a new instance of Microsoft Excel and checks the value of the  **FeatureInstall** property. If the property is set to **msoFeatureInstallNone**, the code displays a message box that asks the user whether they want to change the property setting. If the user responds "Yes," the property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**.


 **注释**  For this example to function properly, you must add a reference to Microsoft Excel Object Library.


```
Dim ExcelApp As New Excel.Application 
Dim intReply As Integer 
 
With ExcelApp 
 If .FeatureInstall = msoFeatureInstallNone Then 
 intReply = MsgBox("Uninstalled features for " _ 
 &amp; "this application may " &amp; vbCrLf _ 
 &amp; "cause a run-time error when called." _ 
 &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf _ 
 &amp; "Would you like to change this setting" &amp; vbCrLf _ 
 &amp; "to automatically install missing features?", _ 
 vbYesNo, "Feature Install Setting") 
 If intReply = vbYes Then 
 .FeatureInstall = msoFeatureInstallOnDemand 
 End If 
 End If 
End With
```
