# MailMergeField Object (Word)

Represents a single mail merge field in a document. The  **MailMergeDataField** object is a member of the **[MailMergeDataFields](a660288d-1a2c-53ec-20d2-c52353be90c8.md)** collection. The **MailMergeDataFields** collection includes all the mail merge related fields in a document.


## Remarks

Use  **Fields** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **MailMergeField** object. The following example displays the field code of the first mail merge field in the active document.


```
MsgBox ActiveDocument.MailMerge.Fields(1).Code
```

Use the  **Add** method to add a merge field to the **MailMergeFields** collection. The following example replaces the selection with a MiddleInitial merge field.




```
ActiveDocument.MailMerge.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, _ 
 Name:="MiddleInitial"
```

The  **MailMergeFields** collection has additional methods, such as **AddAsk** and **AddFillIn**, for adding fields related to a mail merge operation.
