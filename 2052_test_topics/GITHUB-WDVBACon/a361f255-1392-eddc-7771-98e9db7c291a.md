# Document.OMathBreakSub Property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **[WdOMathBreakSub](858bfb92-4a91-d846-21a9-e25c32d7a4b0.md)** constant that represents how Microsoft Word handles a subtraction operator that falls before a line break. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **OMathBreakSub**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **Document** object.


## Remarks

This property is used only when the  **[OMathBreakBin](7ec16236-3597-232b-f640-2a9c5713865e.md)** property is set to **wdOMathBreakBinRepeat**. Subtraction sometimes receives special treatment when a line break falls on a subtraction operator and the document setting is to repeat the subtraction operator on the following line, because two negatives make a positive. Some writers choose to convert one of the minus signs into a plus sign, and some choose to keep the two negatives.
