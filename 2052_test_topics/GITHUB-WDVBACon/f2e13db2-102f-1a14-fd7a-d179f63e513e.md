# ShapeNodes Object (Word)

A collection of all the  **[ShapeNode](d5afb71a-a218-57f3-87f0-171094ba6610.md)** objects in the specified freeform. Each **ShapeNode** object represents either a node between segments in a freeform or a control point for a curved segment of a freeform.


## Remarks

You can create a freeform manually or by using the  **BuildFreeform** and **ConvertToShape** methods.

Use the  **Nodes** property to return the **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example deletes node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.




```
ActiveDocument.Shapes(3).Nodes.Delete 4
```

Use the  **Insert** method to create a new node and add it to the **ShapeNodes** collection. The following example adds a smooth node with a curved segment after node four in shape three on the active document. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform with at least four nodes.




```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(3).Nodes 
 .Insert 4, msoSegmentCurve, msoEditingSmooth, 210, 100 
End With
```

Use  **Nodes** (Index), where Index is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on the active document is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.




```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
End With
```
