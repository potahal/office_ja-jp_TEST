## Syntax

 _表达式_ A variable that represents an **[Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object that has been declared with events in a class module. For more information about using events with the **Application** object, see[Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md).


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Sel_|必需|**Selection**|The current selection.|
| _Cancel_|必需|**Boolean**|**False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True**, the default double-click action does not occur when the procedure is finished.|

## Example

This example prompts the user for a yes or no response before executing the default double-click action. This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1.md)for directions on how to accomplish this.


```
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application

 Dim intResponse As Integer 
 intResponse = MsgBox("Selection = " &amp; Sel &amp; vbLf &amp; vbLf _ 
 &amp; "Continue with operation on this selection?", _ 
 vbYesNo) 
 If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
