# Document.CompatibilityMode Property (Word)

Returns a  **Long** that specifies the compatibility mode that Word uses when opening the document. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **CompatibilityMode**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

When you open a document in Word that was created in a previous version of Word, Compatibility Mode is turned on. Compatibility Mode ensures that no new or enhanced features in Word are available while working with a document, so that people who edit the document using previous versions of Word will have full editing capabilities.


## Example

The following example shows how to check if a document is in full fidelity mode before using a new feature. In this case, if the document compatibility mode supports using content controls, then a check box content control is added to the document.


```
Sub InsertCheckbox()
       
    If (Application.Version = ActiveDocument.CompatibilityMode) Then
          Selection.Range.ContentControls.Add (wdContentControlCheckBox)
    End If    
End Sub
```
