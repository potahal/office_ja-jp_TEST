# ShapeNode Object (Word)

Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform. Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The  **ShapeNode** object is a member of the **ShapeNodes** collection. The **[ShapeNodes](f2e13db2-102f-1a14-fd7a-d179f63e513e.md)** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.


## Remarks

Use  **Nodes** (Index), where Index is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on the active document is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.


```
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(3) 
 If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then 
 .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth 
 End If 
End With
```
