# SynonymInfo.Word Property (Word)

Returns the word or phrase that was looked up by the thesaurus. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Word**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **[SynonymInfo](0af2d733-a038-1f67-ddca-2b05b3af1b7c.md)** object.


## Remarks

The thesaurus will sometimes look up a shortened version of the string or range used to return the  **SynonymInfo** object. The **Word** property allows you to see the exact string that was used.


## Example

This example returns a list of synonyms for the first meaning of the third word in the active document.


```
Sub Syn() 
 Dim mySynObj As Object 
 Dim SList As Variant 
 Dim i As Variant 
 
 Set mySynObj = ActiveDocument.Words(3).SynonymInfo 
 SList = mySynObj.SynonymList(1) 
 For i = 1 To UBound(SList) 
 MsgBox "A synonym for " &amp; mySynObj.Word _ 
 &amp; " is " &amp; SList(i) 
 Next i 
End Sub
```

This example checks to make sure that the word or phrase that was looked up isn't empty. If it is not, the example returns a list of synonyms for the first meaning of the word or phrase.




```
Sub SelectWord() 
 Dim mySynObj As Object 
 Dim SList As Variant 
 Dim i As Variant 
 
 Set mySynObj = Selection.Range.SynonymInfo 
 If mySynObj.Word = "" Then 
 MsgBox "Please select a word or phrase" 
 Else 
 SList = mySynObj.SynonymList(1) 
 For i = 1 To UBound(SList) 
 MsgBox "A synonym for " &amp; mySynObj.Word _ 
 &amp; " is " &amp; SList(i) 
 Next i 
 End If 
End Sub 

```
