# Application.AutomationSecurity Property (Word)

Returns or sets an  **MsoAutomationSecurity** constant that represents the security setting Microsoft Word uses when programmatically opening files. .


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **AutomationSecurity**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents an **[Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object.


## Remarks

The default setting of the  **AutomationSecurity** property is **msoAutomationSecurityLow**. Therefore, to avoid changing the users security settings or breaking solutions that rely on the default setting, you should be careful to set this property back to its original setting after programmatically opening a file.

Setting  **ScreenUpdating** to **False** does not affect alerts and will not affect security warnings. The **DisplayAlerts** setting will not apply to security warnings. For example, if the user sets **DisplayAlerts** equal to **False** and **AutomationSecurity** to **msoAutomationSecurityByUI**, while the user is on Medium security level, then there will be security warnings while a macro is running. This allows the macro to trap file open errors, while still showing the security warning if the file open succeeds.


## Example

This example changes the setting to disable macros, displays the  **Open** dialog box, and then sets the **AutomationSecurity** property back to its original setting.


```
Sub Security() 
 Dim lngAutomation As MsoAutomationSecurity 
 
 With Application 
 lngAutomation = .AutomationSecurity 
 .AutomationSecurity = msoAutomationSecurityForceDisable 
 With .FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen) 
 .Show 
 .Execute 
 End With 
 .AutomationSecurity = lngAutomation 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
