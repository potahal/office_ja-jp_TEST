# Field.Code Property (Word)

Returns a  **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object that represents a field's code. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Code**

 _表达式_ A variable that represents a **[Field](75139aa4-89f4-2ffb-b964-8dc805b9a32b.md)** object.


## Remarks

A field's code is everything that's enclosed by the field characters ( **{ }** ) including the leading space and trailing space characters. You can access a field's code without changing the view from field results.


## Example

This example displays the field code for each field in the active document.


```
Dim fieldLoop As Field 
 
For Each fieldLoop In ActiveDocument.Fields 
 MsgBox Chr(34) &amp; fieldLoop.Code.Text &amp; Chr(34) 
Next fieldLoop
```

This example changes the field code for the first field in the active document to CREATEDATE.




```
Dim rngTemp As Range 
 
Set rngTemp = ActiveDocument.Fields(1).Code 
rngTemp.Text = " CREATEDATE " 
ActiveDocument.Fields(1).Update
```

This example determines whether the active document includes a mail merge field named "Title."




```
Dim fieldLoop As Field 
 
For Each fieldLoop In ActiveDocument.MailMerge.Fields 
 If InStr(1, fieldLoop.Code.Text, "Title", 1) Then 
 MsgBox "A Title merge field is in this document" 
 End If 
Next fieldLoop
```
