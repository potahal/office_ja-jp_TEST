# View.ReadingLayoutActualView Property (Word)

Sets or returns a  **Boolean** that represents whether pages displayed in reading layout view are displayed using the same layout as printed pages.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **ReadingLayoutActualView**

 _表达式_ An expression that returns a **[View](8bf5b26b-14c0-1985-65b2-3e034360baeb.md)** object.


## Remarks

In reading layout view, pages are not displayed with the full content contained in the literal printed pages, as you would see in normal view or in print layout view. Instead they are displayed in screens. When the  **ReadingLayoutActualView** property is set to **True**, the document is displayed as it would appear when printed. On smaller monitors, this requires a zoom level that makes the document hard to read, but it is fine for larger monitors.


## Example

The following example displays the pages in reading layout view as they would appear if they were printed.


```
ActiveWindow.View.ReadingLayout = True 
ActiveWindow.View.ReadingLayoutActualView = True
```
