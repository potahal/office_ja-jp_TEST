# Selection.SetRange Method (Word)

Sets the starting and ending character positions for the selection.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **SetRange**( ** _Start_**, ** _End_** )

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Start_|必需|**Long**|The starting character position of the selection.|
| _End_|必需|**Long**|The ending character position of the selection.|

## Remarks

Character position values start at the beginning of the story, with the first value being 0 (zero). All characters are counted, including nonprinting characters. Hidden characters are counted even if they're not displayed.

The  **SetRange** method redefines the starting and ending positions of an existing **Selection** object. This method differs from the **Range** method, which is used to create a **Range** object, given a starting and ending position.


## Example

This example selects the first 10 characters in the document.


```
Selection.SetRange Start:=0, End:=10
```

This example extends the selection to the end of the document.




```
Selection.SetRange Start:=Selection.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Content.End
```
