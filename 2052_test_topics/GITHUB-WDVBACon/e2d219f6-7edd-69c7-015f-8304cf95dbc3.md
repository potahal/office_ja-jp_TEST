# ChartGroup.Overlap Property (Word)

Specifies how bars and columns are positioned. Read/write  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **Overlap**

 _表达式_ A variable that represents a **[ChartGroup](ea5a2610-9c00-9c95-8366-f9b0fcdf90be.md)** object.


## Remarks

 This property applies only to 2-D bar and 2-D column charts.

You can set this property to a value from -100 through 100. If this property is set to -100, bars are positioned so that there is one bar width between them. If the overlap is 0 (zero), there is no space between bars (one bar starts immediately after the preceding bar). If the overlap is 100, bars are positioned on top of each other.


## Example

The following example sets the overlap for chart group one of the first chart in the active document to -50. You should run the example on a 2-D column chart that has two or more series.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 .Chart.ChartGroups(1).Overlap = -50 
 End If 
End With
```
