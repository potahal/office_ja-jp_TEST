# ShapeRange.LockAnchor Property (Word)

 **True** if the anchor for the specified **ShapeRange** object is locked to the anchoring range. Read/write **Long**.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **LockAnchor**

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[ShapeRange](7112acc0-e241-16ef-77bc-101b72d05af0.md)** object.


## Remarks

When a range of shapes has a locked anchor, you cannot move the shapes' anchor by dragging it. The anchor does not move as the shape is moved.

A  **ShapeRange** object is anchored to a range of text, but you can position it anywhere on the page. If the range of shapes is anchored to the beginning of the first paragraph that contains the anchoring range, the shapes always remain on the same page as the anchor.
