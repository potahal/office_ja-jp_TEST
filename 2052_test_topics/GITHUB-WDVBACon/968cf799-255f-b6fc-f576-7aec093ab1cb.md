This example assumes that you have declared an application variable called MailMergeApp in your general declarations and have set the variable equal to the Microsoft Word Application object.


```
Private Sub MailMergeApp_MailMergeBeforeMerge(ByVal Doc As Document, _ 
 ByVal StartRecord As Long, ByVal EndRecord As Long, _ 
 Cancel As Boolean) 
 
 Dim intVBAnswer As Integer 
 
 'Request whether the user wants to continue with the merge 
 intVBAnswer = MsgBox("Mail Merge for " &amp; _ 
 Doc.Name &amp; " is now starting. " &amp; _ 
 "Do you want to continue?", vbYesNo, "MailMergeBeforeMerge Event") 
 
 'If users response to question is No, cancel the merge process 
 'and deliver a message to the user stating the merge is canceled 
 If intVBAnswer = vbNo Then 
 Cancel = True 
 MsgBox "You have canceled mail merge for " &amp; _ 
 Doc.Name &amp; "." 
 End If 
 
End Sub
```
