# Range.MoveWhile Method (Word)

Moves the specified range while any of the specified characters are found in the document.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **MoveWhile**( ** _Cset_**, ** _Count_** )

 _表达式_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Cset_|必需|**Variant**|One or more characters. This argument is case sensitive.|
| _Count_|可选|**Variant**|The maximum number of characters by which the specified range is to be moved. Can be a number or either the  **wdForward** or **wdBackward** constant. If Count is a positive number, the specified range is moved forward in the document, beginning at the end position. If it is a negative number, the range is moved backward, beginning at the start position. The default value is **wdForward**.|

## Remarks

While any character in Cset is found, the specified range is moved. The resulting  **Range** object is positioned as an insertion point after whatever Cset characters were found. This method returns the number of characters by which the specified range was moved, as a **Long** value. If no Cset characters are found, the range isn't changed and the method returns 0 (zero).


## Example

This example moves  _aRange_ while any of the following (uppercase or lowercase) letters are found: "a", "t", or "i".


```
Dim aRange As Range 
Set aRange = ActiveDocument.Characters(1) 
aRange.MoveWhile Cset:="atiATI", Count:=wdForward
```
