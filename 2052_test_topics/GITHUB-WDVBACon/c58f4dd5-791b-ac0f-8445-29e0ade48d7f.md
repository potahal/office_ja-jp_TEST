## Syntax

 _表达式_. **MoveStart**( ** _Unit_**, ** _Count_** )

### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Unit_|可选|**WdUnits**|The unit by which start position of the specified selection is to be moved. Can be one of the  **WdUnits** constants. The default value is **wdCharacter**.|
| _Count_|可选|**Variant**|The maximum number of units by which the specified selection is to be moved. If Count is a positive number, the start position of the selection is moved forward in the document. If it is a negative number, the start position is moved backward. If the start position is moved forward to a position beyond the end position, the selection is collapsed and both the start and end positions are moved together. The default value is 1.|

### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

This method returns an integer that indicates the number of units by which the start position or the selection actually moved, or it returns 0 (zero) if the move was unsuccessful.


## Example

This example moves the start position of the selection one character forward (the selection size is reduced by one character). Note that a space is considered a character.


```
Selection.MoveStart Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1
```

This example moves the start position of the selection to the beginning of the line (the selection is extended to the start of the line).




```
Selection.MoveStart Unit:=wdLine, Count:=-1
```
