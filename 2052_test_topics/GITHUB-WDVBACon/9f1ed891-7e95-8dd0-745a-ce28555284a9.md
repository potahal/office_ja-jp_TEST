# HiLoLines Object (Word)

Represents the high-low lines in a chart group.


## Remarks

 High-low lines connect the highest point with the lowest point in every category in the chart group. Only 2-D line groups can have high-low lines. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single high-low line; you either enable high-low lines for all points in a chart group or disable them.

If the  **[HasHiLoLines](5713e885-9f36-6b6c-2622-a813cba2077b.md)** property is **False**, most properties of the **HiLoLines** object are disabled.


## Example

Use the  **[HiLoLines](452f4e5d-7ad8-76ad-5067-2df8a074d6d1.md)** property to return the **HiLoLines** object. The following example uses the **HasHiLowLines** property to add high-low lines to the first chart (the chart must be a line chart) in the active document. The example then makes the high-low lines blue.


```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1) 
 If .HasChart Then 
 With Chart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasHighLowLines = True 
 .HiLoLines.Border.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 
 End With 
 End If 
End With
```
