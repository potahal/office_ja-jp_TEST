# Workbook.ExclusiveAccess Method (Excel)

Assigns the current user exclusive access to the workbook that's open as a shared list.


## Syntax

 _表达式_. **ExclusiveAccess**

 _表达式_ A variable that represents a **Workbook** object.


### Return Value

Boolean


## Remarks

The  **ExclusiveAccess** method saves any changes you've made to the workbook and requires other users who have the workbook open to save their changes to a different file.

If the specified workbook isn't open as a shared list, this method fails. To determine whether a workbook is open as a shared list, use the  **[MultiUserEditing](dc721463-ec34-8c52-6701-51c406beed23.md)** property.


## Example

This example determines whether the active workbook is open as a shared list. If it is, the example gives the current user exclusive access.


```
If ActiveWorkbook.MultiUserEditing Then 
 ActiveWorkbook.ExclusiveAccess 
End If
```
