| _Arg2_|必需|**Double**|Nper - the total number of payments for the loan.|
| _Arg3_|必需|**Double**|Pv - the present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now; also known as the principal.|
| _Arg4_|可选|**Variant**|Fv - the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.|

## Remarks

For a more complete description of the arguments in PMT, see the PV function.



|**Set type equal to**|**If payments are due**|
|:-----|:-----|
|0 or omitted|At the end of the period|
|1|At the beginning of the period|

- The payment returned by PMT includes principal and interest but no taxes, reserve payments, or fees sometimes associated with loans.
    
- Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at an annual interest rate of 12 percent, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12 percent for rate and 4 for nper.
