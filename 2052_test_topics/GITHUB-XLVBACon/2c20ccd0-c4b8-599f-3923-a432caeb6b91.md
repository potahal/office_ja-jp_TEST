|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Filename_|必需|**String**|**Variant**. A string that indicates the name of the file to be saved. You can include a full path; if you don't, Microsoft Excel saves the file in the current folder.|
| _FileFormat_|可选|**Variant**|The file format to use when you save the file. For a list of valid choices, see the  **[XlFileFormat](4c0ebc4c-915c-c199-ee39-f4d14ba7b64e.md)** enumeration. For an existing file, the default format is the last file format specified; for a new file, the default is the format of the version of Excel being used.|
| _Password_|可选|**Variant**|A case-sensitive string (no more than 15 characters) that indicates the protection password to be given to the file.|
| _WriteResPassword_|可选|**Variant**|A string that indicates the write-reservation password for this file. If a file is saved with the password and the password isn't supplied when the file is opened, the file is opened as read-only.|
| _ReadOnlyRecommended_|可选|**Variant**|**True** to display a message when the file is opened, recommending that the file be opened as read-only.|
| _CreateBackup_|可选|**Variant**|**True** to create a backup file.|
| _AddToMru_|可选|**Variant**|**True** to add this workbook to the list of recently used files. The default value is **False**.|

| _TextVisualLayout_|可选|**Variant**|Not used in U.S. English Microsoft Excel.|
| _Local_|可选|**Variant**|**True** saves files against the language of Microsoft Excel (including control panel settings). **False** (default) saves files against the language of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) (which is typically US English unless the VBA project where Workbooks.Open is run from is an old internationalized XL5/95 VBA project).|

## Remarks

Use strong passwords that combine upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Use a strong password that you can remember so that you don't have to write it down
